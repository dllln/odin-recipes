      <h2>How to Make Au Gratin Potatoes</h2>
      <p>Here is the step by step recipe -- Enjoy!</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a 1-quart
          casserole dish.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Layer 1/2 of the potatoes in the bottom of the prepared casserole
          dish; season with salt and pepper. Layer onion slices over top, then
          top with the remaining potatoes. Season again with salt and pepper
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Gradually whisk in
          flour and salt and cook, whisking constantly until raw flour flavor
          has cooked off, about 1 minute. Gradually add milk, about 1/4 cup at a
          time, whisking well after each addition to incorporate; the gradual
          addition and whisking of milk will help avoid lumps in your sauce.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture has thickened, 3 to 5
          min.Stir in cheese all at once; continue stirring until melted, 30 to
          60 seconds. Pour cheese sauce over the potatoes, and cover the dish
          with aluminum foil.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender and sauce is
          bubbly, about 1 Â½ hours.
        </li>
        <br />
      </ol>
